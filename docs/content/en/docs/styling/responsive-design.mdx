# Responsive Design

Responsive design is a fundamental concept in modern front-end development. It enables websites and applications to seamlessly adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

> Nex UI uses a mobile-first breakpoint system, and when you write responsive styles, it utilizes the minimum width media query `@media (min-width)`.

Nex UI provides 5 default breakpoints:

```ts
const breakoptions = {
  sm: '640px',
  md: '768px',
  lg: '1024px',
  xl: '1280px',
  '2xl': '1536px',
}
```

## Using Breakpoints

You can use the above breakpoints in [the `sx` prop](/docs/styling/sx-prop), [`defineRecipe`](/docs/styling/recipes), or [`defineSlotRecipe`](/docs/styling/slot-recipes).
In these methods, all CSS properties support responsive values for specific breakpoints.

There are two ways to define a set of breakpoints: as an object or as an array.

### Object Values

The following example demonstrates how to define a set of breakpoints using the object syntax:

<FlexCenter
  align='center'
  justify='center'
  sx={{
    backgroundImage: 'linear-gradient(to top right, #f77062 0%, #fe5196 100%)',
    py: 10,
    borderRadius: 'sm',
  }}
>
  <Box
    sx={{
      width: {
        _sm: 200,
        _md: 300,
        _lg: 400,
        _xl: 500,
        _2xl: 600,
      },
      backdropFilter: 'blur(12px)',
      bg: '#fff9',
      borderRadius: 'sm',
      py: 2,
      px: 7,
      color: 'black',
    }}
  >
    This box has a responsive width.
  </Box>
</FlexCenter>

```tsx
import { Box } from '@nex-ui/react'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Box
      sx={{
        width: {
          _sm: 200, // @media (min-width: 640px) { width: 200px }
          _md: 300, // @media (min-width: 768px) { width: 300px }
          _lg: 400, // @media (min-width: 1024px) { width: 400px }
          _xl: 500, // @media (min-width: 1280px) { width: 500px }
          _2xl: 600, // @media (min-width: 1536px) { width: 600px }
        },
      }}
    >
      This box has a responsive width.
    </Box>
  )
}
```

### Array Values

The second way is to define your breakpoints as an array, arranged in ascending order. As shown below:

<FlexCenter
  align='center'
  justify='center'
  sx={{
    backgroundImage: 'linear-gradient(120deg, #89f7fe 0%, #66a6ff 100%)',
    py: 10,
    borderRadius: 'sm',
    color: 'black',
  }}
>
  <Box
    sx={{
      width: [200, 300, 400],
      backdropFilter: 'blur(12px)',
      bg: '#fff9',
      borderRadius: 'sm',
      py: 2,
      px: 7,
    }}
  >
    This box has a responsive width.
  </Box>
</FlexCenter>

```tsx
<Box sx={{ width: [200, 300, 400] }}>This box has a responsive width.</Box>

// [200, 300, 400] corresponds to [breakpoints.sm, breakpoints.md, breakpoints.lg]
```

<Callout type='info'>
This way should only be considered when the number of breakpoints in the theme is limited, such as in the case of only three breakpoints.

If you need to define more than just a few breakpoints, we recommend using the object API.

</Callout>

You can skip the corresponding breakpoint by using `null | undefined`:

```tsx
<Box sx={{ width: [200, null, 400] }}>This box has a responsive width.</Box>
```

Of course, whether as an array or an object, the `width` property value can be modified to use size tokens or size semantic tokens. This also means that other CSS properties support corresponding token types.

## Breakpoints Selector

Through the above two methods, the process of defining and implementing responsive breakpoints for a single CSS property is greatly simplified. If you want to achieve responsiveness for a group of CSS properties, you can use breakpoints as selectors:

```tsx
<Box
  sx={{
    _md: {
      width: 300,
      height: 300,
    },
    _lg: {
      width: 400,
      height: 400,
    },
  }}
>
  This box has a responsive size.
</Box>
```

This approach is more conducive to understanding and maintenance in complex CSS styling scenarios.

## Customizing Breakpoints

You can also define custom breakpoints and use them as keys when defining the breakpoint object.
