# Colors

Nex UI provides a set of default color palettes out of the box, which are very suitable for use when you haven't determined the specific brand color scheme.

These colors are divided into common colors and semantic colors.

- Common colors: Ensure consistency across themes.
- Semantic colors: Adjust according to the selected theme.
