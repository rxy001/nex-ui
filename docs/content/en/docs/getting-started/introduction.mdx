# Nex UI

Nex UI is an open-source React component library that helps you build beautiful user interfaces. The meticulously designed components are ready for production use out of the box, significantly saving development time and effort.

Nex UI aims to simplify the development process and provide beautiful and highly adaptable system design to improve user experience.

### Web Accessibility

Nex UI components follow WAI-ARIA standards and are designed with full consideration for accessibility, ensuring that users from different groups can all obtain excellent interactive experiences.

### Dark Mode

Nex UI not only comes with a beautifully designed dark theme built-in, but also provides you with a convenient solution to quickly implement dark mode for your applications.

### Customizable Theme

Nex UI is built on Emotion, providing you with highly flexible theme customization capabilities to meet diverse design needs. You can easily customize themes without Less, Sass, or CSS variables.

### Faster Style Design

All Nex UI components support the `sx` prop and provide flexible, universal wrapper components like `Box` and `nex`. You can quickly design their styles through the `sx` prop.

### Using TypeScript

Nex UI is written in TypeScript and seamlessly integrates with your TypeScript projects.

### Design Composable Component APIs

Nex UI additionally provides a CSS-in-JS solution. Through `Recipes` or `SlotRecipes`, you can easily design component styles while automatically generating type-safe composable component APIs. This provides convenience when extending your own components.
