# Nex UI

Nex UI is an open-source React component library that helps you create beautiful user interfaces. The meticulously designed components can be directly used in production environments right out of the box, significantly saving development time and effort.

Nex UI aims to simplify the development process and offer an aesthetically pleasing and highly adaptable system design to enhance the user experience.

### Dark mode

Nex UI not only comes with a beautifully designed dark theme out of the box, but also provides you with a convenient solution to quickly implement the dark mode for your applications.

### Customizable theme

Nex UI is built on Emotion, endowing you with highly flexible theme customization capabilities to meet diverse design needs. You can easily customize themes without using Less, Sass, or CSS variables.

### Design styles more quickly.

All components in Nex UI support the `sx` prop. It also provides flexible and versatile wrapper components such as `Box` and `nex`. You can quickly design their styles through the `sx` prop.

### TypeScript

Nex UI is written in TypeScript, which can seamlessly integrate with your TypeScript projects.

### Design composable component API.

Nex UI additionally offers a CSS-in-JS writing solution. With `Recipes` or `SlotRecipes`, you can easily design component styles while automatically generating a composable component API with type safety. This provides convenience when extending your own components.
